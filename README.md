You can download the game or play a web version [here on itch.io](https://spicyroboto.itch.io/palette-piggy).

## Editing, Building, and Running from Source
The game was written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine.

The source code can be run directly via LÖVE, or through the [ZeroBrane Studio IDE](https://studio.zerobrane.com/). If using ZeroBrane Studio be sure that your environment is set to LÖVE and that the root of the repository is the project folder before running.

Level maps can be edited in the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/). Note that they must be exported to the `.lua` format first.

The music was provided by [Visager](https://twitter.com/visagermusic) from her [Songs from an Unmade Forest World](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_from_an_Unmade_Forest_World/) album.
